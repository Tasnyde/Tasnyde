A little insight into Todd Snyder

Hi All, My name is Todd Snyder, and I have been in supply chain and distribution for nearly 20 years. I have managed multiple distribution centers ranging from 150k square feet to a million.

My Career Passions

I love supply chain distribution. However, I am currently looking to pivot in my career. I no longer want to be tied to a building. I would rather consult, and I am hoping as I learn more about AI, I hope I can leverage those skill to bring value to organizations looking to improver their supply chains and distribution networks.

My Hobbies

One of my favorite things to do is to travel. I have a goal of hitting all seven continents. I have two left to get to and cannot wait to check it off my bucket list.
